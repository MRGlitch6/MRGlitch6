Driven Programmer with 3 years of Java and some college experience. 
Although life brings many hardships, I am working vigorously to build my skills in everyday jobs while also maintaining personal work in the programming world. 
From my wide experience at a young age I have learned valuable skills to work with customers and to keep a high morale in the workplace. 
My passion for programming keeps me fighting to build the career I love and I'm ready for any challenges my future jobs may give me.
